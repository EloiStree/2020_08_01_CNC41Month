#CNC 41 Month
In the contect of the Open Macro Input project, I need ot learn how to use CNC machine to craft object connectable with Arduino and Bluetooth.

During the month of August 2020, I am going to force myself not to code to much ;).
And so to learn about how to use a CNC miling machine(s) :).

So if you are in to that. Feel free to follow the adventure.
