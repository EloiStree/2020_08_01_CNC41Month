# CNC 4-1 Month
In the contect of the Open Macro Input project, I need ot learn how to use CNC machine to craft object connectable with Arduino and Bluetooth.

During the month of August 2020, I am going to force myself not to code to much ;).
And so to learn about how to use a CNC miling machine(s) :).

So if you are in to that. Feel free to follow the adventure.


## Note for future comment/uestion/other: Only CNC
Consider that during all this open project I am going to only targeting CNC.
Most of the information on this documented experiment won't target Laser Cutting or printing in 3D except if it have a direct impact on a CNC project.

------------------------------------

### Stream / Media.
I need to check the authorization.
But if I spend one month on the project.
It would be a minimum to do some videos/photo/stream.  
And a post-mortem at the end.  

So find here later when I plan to Vlog the result of the experiment.
