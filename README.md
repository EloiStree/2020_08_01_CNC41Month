# CNC 4-1 Month

CNC for one month is a research and development project where I try to learn the maximum that I can in one month to master the CNC in my future project.
As my steps can be useful for every new comer to the CNC world. It was important for me to mark them somewhere.

So if you are a newbie in this world. 
Welcome to you :)

PS: If you see an empty post it often means that I work on it but forget it or did not take the time to post on it.
